# LeetCode: A Journey Through Patterns 

Welcome to my problem-solving repository! Instead of just solving problems one by one, I focus on mastering the patterns behind them. By learning the underlying logic from basic loops to complex dynamic programming .I build solutions that are both efficient and scalable.

## My Philosophy
> "Don't memorize the solution; master the pattern."

I document my progress here to track my growth in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) and to keep myself accountable on my path to becoming a better developer.

### 🛠️ Patterns I'm Mastering
    **Sliding Window** (Efficiently handling arrays/strings)
    **Two Pointers** (Optimizing search and comparisons)
    **Fast & Slow Pointers** (Linked list cycles)
    **Breadth-First Search (BFS) / DFS** (Tree & Graph traversals)
    **Dynamic Programming** (Optimizing recursive solutions)
