# LeetCode: A Journey Through Patterns 

Welcome to my problem-solving repository! Instead of just solving problems one by one, I focus on mastering the patterns behind them. By learning the underlying logic from basic loops to complex dynamic programming .I build solutions that are both efficient and scalable.

## My Philosophy
> "Don't memorize the solution; master the pattern."

I document my progress here to track my growth in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) and to keep myself accountable on my path to becoming a better developer.
